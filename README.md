# RLang v1 (In Progress)

## Getting Started

> **Requires** Python 3.7
- Create virtual environment (conda or venv)
- Activate environment and Pip install dependencies 
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Clone this [simple_rl](https://github.com/rafarodsa/simple_rl)) fork and pip-install it.
    ```pip install path/to/simple_rl/.```

## Directory structure

- `envs/`: (custom) environments for examples
- `examples/`: example RLang programs and RLang-informed agents. 
- `experiments/`: experiments classes for handling RLang experiments (for paper)
- `rlang/`: contains lmdp and language packages.
    - `lmdp/`: contains all main classes for RLang parsing.
        - `LMDPClass.py`: contains LMDP (Language-informed MDP) that encapsulates all the information derived from an RLang program (**to refactor**)
        - `agents/`: module containing rlang-informed agent implementations and supporting classes (**to refactor** and to move outside lmdp directory)
        - `grounding/`: contains relevant modules to support expressions for RLang
        - `utils/`: supporting classes and functions for __lmdp.grounding__
    - `language/`: contains the python files for lexing/parsing/listening. Most of these files are generated by Antlr4.
    
## Building the Lexer and Parser with Antlr4

Simply run `mvn compile` from the root directory. 
Clean with `mvn clean`. Check out `antlr/README.md` 
and `antlr/pom.xml` for more info on the parser and 
lexer development process.
