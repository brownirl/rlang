# RLang v0.0.1 (In Progress)

## Getting Started

> **Requires** Python 3.7
- Create virtual environment (conda or venv)
- Activate environment and Pip install dependencies 
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Clone this [simple_rl](https://github.com/rafarodsa/simple_rl)) fork and pip-install it.
    ```pip install path/to/simple_rl/.```

## Directory structure

- `envs/`: (custom) environments for examples
- `examples/`: example RLang programs and RLang-informed agents. 
- `experiments/`: experiments classes for handling RLang experiments (for paper)
- `rlang/`: contains lmdp and language packages.
  - `src/`: contains the source code for RLang
    - `api_functions.py`: contains some of the most helpful functions which are exposed by the API.
    - `language/`: contains the python files for lexing/parsing/listening. Most of these files are generated by Antlr4.
    - `grounding/`: contains all the RLang groundings.
    - `lmdp/` **(DEPRECATED)** : contains all main classes for RLang parsing.
      - `LMDPClass.py`: contains LMDP (Language-informed MDP) that encapsulates all the information derived from an RLang program (**to refactor**)
      - `agents/`: module containing rlang-informed agent implementations and supporting classes (**to refactor** and to move outside lmdp directory)
      - `grounding/`: contains relevant modules to support expressions for RLang
      - `utils/`: supporting classes and functions for __lmdp.grounding__
  - `docs/`
  - `tests/`
    
    
## Building the Lexer and Parser with Antlr4

- Run `mvn compile` from the root directory to run Antlr4.
- Clean with `mvn clean`, though it should do it automatically in each build cycle.
- Run tests with `mvn test`.
- Check out `antlr/README.md` and `antlr/pom.xml` for more info on grammar development.

## Building the documentation with Sphinx

- You can easily generate html files by running `make html` from `rlang/docs/`
- If you add or remove a module, run `sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../src/ ../src/language` from `rlang/docs/`
