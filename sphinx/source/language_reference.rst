This page covers the core syntax and semantics of the RLang language.

Format of an RLang Program
--------------------------

An RLang program takes the following form:

.. productionlist::
   program: import* declaration*

where each declaration is the instantiation of an RLang grounding:

.. productionlist::
   declaration: constant NL+
    : | action NL+
    : | factor NL+
    : | proposition NL+
    : | goal NL+
    : | feature NL+
    : | markov_feature NL+
    : | option
    : | policy
    : | effect

See :doc:`grounding_reference` for these declarations explained in detail.


RLang Groundings Syntax
-----------------------

Every RLang object is a function with a domain in :math:`\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{S}`
and a co-domain in :math:`\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathbb{R}^n` where :math:`n\in \mathbb{N}`, or :math:`\{\top, \bot\}`,
depending on the objectâ€™s type.

We should include the ebnf inside all of these

Factors
^^^^^^^

Factors are used to reference independent state variables.
They represent portions of the state space and can be defined using Python's slicing syntax ``[start?:end?]`` on the current state variable ``S``:

.. code-block:: text

    Factor x_position := S[0]
    Factor y_position := S[1]
    Factor inventory := S[2:]


Features
^^^^^^^^

Features are used to define more complex functions of state. They can be defined using arithmetic operations (+, -, :math:`*`, /), numeric literals, function compositions.

.. code-block:: text

    Feature distance_to_gold := abs([0,4] - position)


Propositions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Propositions are functions of the form :math:`\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \{\top, \bot\}`, generating a boolean value.
They can be defined using logical operators (``and``, ``or``, ``not``) and order relations of the real numbers (<, <= , >, >=, =, !=)

.. code-block:: text

    Constant workbench_locations := [[1, 0], [1, 3]]
    Proposition at_workbench := position in workbench_locations
    Proposition have_bridge_material := iron >= 1 and wood >= 1


Goals
^^^^^

Goals are used to specify goal states given by a proposition.

.. code-block:: text

    Goal get_gold := gold >= 1


Markov Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Markov Features allow users to compute features on an (:math:`s,a,s'`) experience tuple
and can be then used to define partial specification of functions related to the task, such as action-value functions and transition functions.
**Note:** the prime operator (``'``) can be used to reference the valueof an RLang object on the next state.

.. code-block:: text

    Markov Feature inventory_change := inventory' -inventory


Policies
^^^^^^^^

Policies prompt the agent to perform an action/subpolicy in a given situation.
The keyword ``Execute`` is used to perform an action or call another policy and
*provides a prior probability for the action to be executed*.

Policies can be specified in RLang using conditional or probabilistic expressions.
Conditional expressions are written using the keywords ``if`` and ``else``, and
probability expressions can be written using the keywords ``with P(float)`` and ``or`` to specify probability values.


The following policy instructs the agent to craft iron tools at a workbench by first collecting ironand then navigating to the workbench.

.. code-block:: text

    Policy main:
    if iron >= 2:
        if at_workbench:
            Execute Use # Use is an action
        else:
            Execute go_to_workbench # go_to_workbench is a policy
    else:
        Execute collect_iron


Here is an example of a probabilistic policy. *Note that for the probabilities to be correct their sum must be equal to
1.*

.. code-block:: text

    Policy random_move:
        Execute up with P(0.25)
        or Execute down with P(0.25)
        or Execute left with P(0.25)
        or Execute right with P(0.25)


Options
^^^^^^^

Temporally-extended abstract actions can be specified using Options, which include initiation and termination propositions.
Initiation propositions are defined using the keyword ``init``, and termination propositions are written using the keyword ``until``.

.. code-block:: text

    Option build_bridge:
    init have_bridge_material and at_workbench
        Execute craft_bridge
    until bridge in inventory


Action Restrictions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Action Restrictions are used to specify constraints on the set of possible actions an agent can take in a given circumstance.
The keyword ``Restrict`` removes an action from consideration in the given situation, *meaning that the action will have
probability zero even after learning.*

.. code-block:: text

    ActionRestriction dont_get_burned:
        if (position + [0, 1]) in lava_locations:
            Restrict up


Effects
^^^^^^^

Effects provide an interface for specifying partial information about the transition and reward functions,
allowing users to denote the consequences of an action when performed in a given state.

The following effect captures the predicted consequence of moving left on the ``x_position`` factor,
stating that the ``x_position`` of the agent in the next state will be less than in the current state.
This Effect also specifies a -0.1 step penalty regardless of the current state or action.

.. code-block:: text

    Effect movement_effect:
        if x_position >= 1 and A == left:
            x_position' -> x_position - 1
        Reward -0.1

When using a factored MDP, Effects can also be used to specify factored transition functions,
i.e. transition functions for individual factors, which we call **predictions**:

Here is a prediction made about the full transition function:

.. code-block:: text

    Effect tic_tac_toe:
        if three_in_a_row:
            S' -> empty_board # Board is reset

Expressions and Keywords
------------------------

Arithmetic Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Arithmetic expressions are the most common expression used in defining RLang groundings.

.. productionlist::
   arithmetic_exp: L_PAR arithmetic_exp R_PAR
    : | arithmetic_exp (TIMES | DIVIDE) arithmetic_exp
    : | arithmetic_exp (PLUS | MINUS) arithmetic_exp
    : | any_number
    : | any_array
    : | any_bound_var

Some examples of arithmetic expressions:

Boolean Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Boolean expressions are also commonly used in Propositions, Goals, Effects, Options, and Policies.

.. productionlist::
   boolean_exp: L_PAR boolean_exp R_PAR
    : | boolean_exp AND boolean_exp
    : | boolean_exp OR boolean_exp
    : | NOT boolean_exp
    : | arithmetic_exp IN arithmetic_exp
    : | boolean_exp (EQ_TO | NOT_EQ) boolean_exp
    : | arithmetic_exp (EQ_TO | LT | GT |
    :    LT_EQ | GT_EQ | NOT_EQ) arithmetic_exp
    : | any_bound_var
    : | (TRUE | FALSE)

Some examples of boolean expressions:

Conditional Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The statements usable in a conditional expression differ between Policies and Effects.

.. productionlist::
   conditional_exp: IF boolean_exp COL INDENT statement NL* DEDENT
   : (ELIF boolean_exp COL INDENT statement NL* DEDENT)*
   : (ELSE COL INDENT statement NL* DEDENT)?;

Some examples of conditional expressions:

Probabilistic Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Special Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``S``, ``A``, ``S'`` are reserved keywords referring to the current state, the current action, and the next state, respectively.
Depending on the type an RLang object, one or more of these keywords can be referenced in the definition of the object.

.. code-block:: text

    S   # Current state - Used in Factors and Features
    A   # Current action - Used in Effects
    S'  # Next state - Used most often in MarkovFeatures
